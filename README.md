Agriculture Web Project

The Agriculture Web Project is an online platform designed to connect farmers with the government of India for selling their crops at fair prices, seeking crop-related information and advice, and accessing soil card services. This project aims to empower farmers by providing them with a direct channel to the government and valuable resources to enhance their crop production.
Key Features

    Crop Selling: Farmers can register their crops on the platform and directly sell them to the government at favorable prices, eliminating the need for     intermediaries and ensuring fair market value.
    Query System: Farmers can ask queries related to their crop production, farming techniques, and other crop-related concerns. Government consultants       and experts are available to provide guidance and support.
